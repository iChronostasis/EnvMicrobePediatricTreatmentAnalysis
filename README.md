# EnvMicrobePediatricTreatmentAnalysis

This repository contains the R and Bash script implementations used in the analysis of whole-genome shotgun sequencing data, as described in the article "Whole-Genome Shotgun Sequencing Unravels the Influence of Environmental Microbial Co-Infections on the Treatment Efficacy for Severe Pediatric Infectious Diseases."

## Overview

The scripts included here focus on the analysis of environmental microbial co-infections and their impact on the treatment outcomes of severe pediatric infectious diseases. The study leverages whole-genome shotgun sequencing to unravel complex interactions within the microbial community associated with pediatric infections.

## Usage

Please refer to the README file for detailed instructions on running and understanding the provided scripts. The code is made available for academic use, and contributions or improvements are welcomed.
